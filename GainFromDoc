    add: from polls import views
    add to urlpatterns: 
      url(r'^polls',views.index,name='index'),#http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/
      url(r'^$',views.index,name='index'),#http://127.0.0.1:8000/

      1.rename the views.py as app_views.py
      change:from polls import pviews
      change:url(r'^polls/',pviews.index,name='index')
      2.specify the packge.module
      change:import polls.views
      change:url(r'^polls/',polls.views.index,name='index')
